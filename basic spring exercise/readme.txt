create an app with:
->myclass.java
->BasketBall.java


#Now myApp asks the Basketball coach about which workout to perform.

THE APP SHOULD WORK FOR EVERY SPORT : therefore we use interface named Coach.java and respective classes for different coaches like:Basketball.java & TrackCoach.java

THE APP SHOULD BE CONFIGURABLE : therefore we use spring.
